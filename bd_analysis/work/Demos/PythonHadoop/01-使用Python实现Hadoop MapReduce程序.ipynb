    "# 01 使用Python实现Hadoop MapReduce程序\n",
    "\n",
    "**本章内容**\n",
    "   \n",
    "编写一个简单的 MapReduce 程序，模仿WordCount并使用Python来实现，该例子通过读取文本文件来统计出单词的出现次数。结果也以文本形式输出，每一行包含一个单词和单词出现的次数，两者中间使用制表符分隔。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. 先决条件\n",
    "\n",
    "编写此程序之前，需要先架设好Hadoop集群，这样才能测试和运行本章示例。如没有架设好，请参考[Docker+Hadoop集群](Docker_Hadoop_Cluster.ipynb)笔记。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. 实现原理\n",
    "\n",
    "使用Python编写MapReduce代码的关键在于HadoopStreaming在Map和Reduce之间传递数据是通过STDIN (标准输入)和STDOUT (标准输出)来进行的。因此可以通过使用Python的sys.stdin来输入数据，使用sys.stdout来输出数据，剩下的交给HadoopStreaming处理即可。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Python代码\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapper\n",
    "\n",
    "将下列的代码存储为word_count_mapper.py文件，此程序将从STDIN读取数据并将单词分隔开，生成单词与其出现次数的映射关系："
